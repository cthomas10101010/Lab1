Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your Spreadsheet and Chart
Open Your Spreadsheet Program:

You can use Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or another similar tool.
Enter the Data:

Create two columns:

Column A: Label it “n (Number of Rings)”
Column B: Label it “Moves (towers(n))”
Enter the data as follows:

n (Number of Rings)	Moves (towers(n))
1	1
2	3
3	7
4	15
5	31
6	63
7	127
8	255
9	511
10	1023
Create the Chart:

Select both columns of data.
Insert a Chart (a line chart or scatter plot is ideal).
Make sure your x-axis is set to “n (Number of Rings)” and your y-axis is set to “Moves (towers(n))”.
Format the chart as needed so it clearly shows the exponential growth.
Take a Screenshot:

Once your chart is ready and clearly shows the data points (and their exponential trend), take a screenshot of your chart.
Save the screenshot as an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
